# Programming and Scripting Problem Set 2019
----


This repository contains my solution to 2019 Problem Set for the Programing and Scripting Moudule at GMIT.
I commenced work on 9th February 2019 and complted the task by the due date of March 31st 2019.

I was completely new to programming and used both class lectures, skype call, on line tutorials and on line code examples to complete the tasks.  As not overly familiar with algebra struggled a little with some of the matametics problems.

## My Repositiory can be download from git hub 
1. Go to Git Hub using the following link (https://github.com/LauraBrogan/pands-problem-set-2019)
2. Click the download button


## Running the Code
1. Make sure you have python installed.
2. From the comand line interface open the folder pands-problem-set-2019
3. For each solution to run enter eg. python solution-1.py etc. and follow the prompts.
4. > [!IMPORTANT]
> This is IMPORTANT
    For Soultion 9 when you enter phyton solution-9.py you will then be asked to enter file name please enter staunton.txt.


## What each file contains

1. **solution-1.py** contains my solution to problem 1 in the problem set.

    This program asks the user to input a positive integer and then outputs the sum of all the nubmers between one and that number.  I have included in my program that it alerts the user if they have not inputed a positve number.

2. **solution-2.py** contains my solution to problem 2 in the problem set.

    When we run this program it outputs to the user if today is a day that begins with letter T.  

3. **solution-3.py** contains my solution to problem 2 in the problem set.

4. **solution-4.py** contains my solution to problem 4 in the problem set.

5. **solution-5.py** contains my solution to problem 5 in the problem set.

6. **solution-6.py** contains my solution to problem 6 in the problem set.

7. **solution-7.py** contains my solution to problem 7 in the problem set.

8. **solution-8.py** contains my solution to problem 8 in the problem set.

9. **solution-9.py** contains my solution to problem 9 in the problem set.


10. **solution-10.py** contains my solution to problem 10 in the problem set.
