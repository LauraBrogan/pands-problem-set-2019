# Programming and Scripting Problem Set Solutions 2019
----


This repository contains my solutions to 2019 Problem Set for the Programing and Scripting Moudule at GMIT.
I commenced work on 9th February 2019 and complted the task by the due date of March 31st 2019.

I was completely new to programming and used both class lectures, skype call, on line tutorials and on line code examples to complete the tasks.  As not overly familiar with algebra struggled a little with some of the matametics problems.

## My Repositiory can be download from git hub 
1. Go to Git Hub using the following link (https://github.com/LauraBrogan/pands-problem-set-2019)
2. Click the download button


## Running the Code
1. Make sure you have python installed.
2. From the comand line interface open the folder pands-problem-set-2019
3. For each solution to run enter eg. python solution-1.py etc. and follow the prompts.
4. > [!IMPORTANT] > This is IMPORTANT
    
    For Soultion 9 when you enter phyton solution-9.py you will then be asked to enter file name please enter staunton.txt.


## What each file contains

1. **solution-1.py** *contains my solution to problem 1 in the problem set.*

    This program asks the user to input a positive integer and then outputs the sum of all the nubmers between one and that number.  I have included in my program that it alerts the user if they have not inputed a positve number.

2. **solution-2.py** *contains my solution to problem 2 in the problem set.*

    When we run this program it outputs to the user if today is a day that begins with letter T or not.  

3. **solution-3.py** *contains my solution to problem 2 in the problem set.*

    When solution-3.py is ran it displays to the user all the numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not by 12. The program checks each items in the range of number between 1,000 and 10,000 to see and then reutrns those that meet both criteria to the user. 

4. **solution-4.py** *contains my solution to problem 4 in the problem set.*

    This program asks the user to enter a positive integer and then applies the collatz conjecture to it which is that all even nubmers are divided by two and any odd number is trippled and one added. The series of numbers are then displayed back to the user. I have included a message to the user if they input an negative number. No matter what number is entered it will always end on 1.

5. **solution-5.py** *contains my solution to problem 5 in the problem set.*

    This program asks the user to input a positive interger and then it tells the user if that number is a prime number or not. I have included that the users gets a message if they enter a number that is not positive. 

6. **solution-6.py** *contains my solution to problem 6 in the problem set.*

    This program asks the user to input a string sentence and outputs every second word. 
    For this I have split the sentence and taken out every second word thats even and then joined the sentence back together to display to the user. 

7. **solution-7.py** *contains my solution to problem 7 in the problem set.*

    This program ask the user to enter a positive number, it converts it to a floating point number and then gets the approximate square root of the number and displays to the user. 

8. **solution-8.py** *contains my solution to problem 8 in the problem set.*

    This program imports python date time module and prints to the user todays date and time in the format "Day, Month Date Year at time am/pm.

9. **solution-9.py** *contains my solution to problem 9 in the problem set.*

    This task was to write a program that reads in a text file and outputs every second line.
    To start when solution-9.py is run it asks the user to input *"Please open text file:"* the user must then enter *"staunton.txt"* and when this is done it will return to the user every second line of this text docoument. 

10. **solution-10.py** *contains my solution to problem 10 in the problem set.*

    This program is a plot of the function x, x^2 and 2^x in the range [0,4]
