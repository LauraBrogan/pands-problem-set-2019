Unseemly feud a sad finale to Cora Staunton's glorious Mayo career ‘Game Changer’ is a story of sporting excellence set against family bereavement 
Cora Staunton:
“We wanted the LGFA and the Mayo County Board to investigate these [issues].
I am not going to speak for girls who have very difficult experiences. 
“Where does it leave me? Well. 
I don’t see myself putting on a Mayo jersey again,” Cora Staunton says evenly on the lasting outcome of the blazing feud which has left a chasm in Mayo football.
It is disconcerting and unquestionably sad that a 24-year inter-county career of phosphorescent brilliance could simply go out as unceremoniously as a light bulb in an airing cupboard.
But there it is.
It’s been a rotten few months, as she tells it. 
Anyone who happened to catch the news even once over the past while couldn’t have been unaware that the Mayo women’s football team – a pioneering force for the sport – has been physically and spiritually gutted in a blaze of ill-feeling, accusation and counter-accusation.
Ten of the panel and two managers gone from the panel after walking out in mid-July. 
A statement released explaining an atmosphere of training that they found intolerable and tantamount to “an unsafe environment”.
There followed a strenuous objection and counter argument from the team manager, Peter Leahy. 
The estrangement deepening into a row which deeply split public opinion and left a mess in its wake – strained friendships, a weakened team and no clean resolution.
I was born stubborn,
Because the walk-out revolved around players from the Carnacon club and because Staunton is that club’s figurehead, the easy assumption is that she orchestrated the collective departure. 
She knows how she can come across on the football field, stroppy at times, domineering; a force of nature. On the day we meet, she has just heard that, in the latest episode in the row, Carnacon had won their appeal and would play at the weekend.
She was happy that she has a ball game to look forward to. 
But there is no joy in any of this. It was difficult to think about anything else and for a few weeks, when things were at their worst, she found herself dreading even walking down the town. 
Now, with cosmically mischievous timing, Game Changer, her biography, is in book shops this weekend. The book, written with Mary White, is a strong self-examination of a football life that began with the utterly carefree pursuit by a child who loved chasing a ball and, like other girls, had to cope with the complications of discovering she was better than almost all the boys at the boys’ game.
And it stretches through three decades to this autumn, when a 36-year-old woman finds herself stirring a single lump of brown sugar into a coffee cup in a busy Castlebar restaurant, 
reasoning aloud how it came to this – an exile from a senior squad that had been like a second family and embarking on the turbulent excitement of a semi-professional career in Australian Rules.
